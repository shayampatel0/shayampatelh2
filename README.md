The purpose of this homework was to create a responsivess portfolio with some of the following characteristics. Adding a sticky footer was a bit challenging but I tried my best. 

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

Using the 12 grid system, I created a container then added additional info to create the info/text for the pages.
